      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a product manager for a large real estate accounting software company. I'm also a single father of two 
        teenage daughters.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from San Diego, CA but I relocated to the DFW area of Texas in 2005.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My primary hobby is riding motorcycles and partaking in long distance rallies. I'm an official Iron Butt 
        Association member (#72302) and aim hoping to be an participant in the 2023 Iron Butt Rally. Outside of 
        motorcycling I also enjoy photography.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Independent Software Developer making a combination of useful utilities and entertaining games.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Allen, TX which is about 20 minutes north of Dallas.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To be honest, I'm more interesting in iOS and macOS development, however any good app is going to need a good website to go with it. Additionally, web development skills 
        are useful within my day job, where I manage a bunch of web developers. Lastly, the ability to freelance to add an additional income stream is attractive as well.
