      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Well, the money is pretty good for one. But for me its more 
        about the freedom possiblities. Even without COVID, it is a 
        career that tolerates remote working more readily than other careers.
        Plus it is quite useful when trying to solve my own project problems to
        be able to just whip out an app or webpage, etc.</p>
